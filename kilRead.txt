Hello devs,, This is Vasu Birla (Kilvish) ...To use this Pix Payment method of Brazil follow these steps 

1. There is a file kilPay.php which is not provided by API,, we have to manually code it, 
	however you dont need to make it just Edit kilPay.php and put your test API key 

2. As well put your Varilables which are being used in your project 
	for example $amount $useremail $item etc. 

3. after doing this you need to make composer.json file (which is already made by me for my projet) 
	you have to just edit it for your vender 

4. after this we have have to generate autoload using composer . but here composer.lock file already exist  

	just open your cmd or server Terminal and run following commands - 

		composer dump-autoload
		composer install
		composer update


	it will create following arch inside your pix sdk folder 

/your sdk folder inside your project
├── composer.json
├── vendor
│   └── ... Composer's generated files and directories ...
├── ... other project files and directories ...  



------------ done .. now open kilPay.php it will create QR code with your request Item, amount and Use ... 

----------------------- If You have Doubt You can contact me on LinkdIn https://in.linkedin.com/in/vasubirla  ........   

Note -  Generating a QR code is just one part of the PIX payment process. To complete a PIX payment, 
you need to provide this QR code to your customers, and they will use a PIX-compatible mobile app to scan it and initiate the payment.

Testing PIX payments when you're in India is very challenging, as PIX is primarily used in Brazil.
 However, You can Contact a Brazilian Partner or Developer: If you have a Brazilian business partner or
 know someone in Brazil who can assist, you can collaborate with them to perform testing.
